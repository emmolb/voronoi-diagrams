# voronoi-diagrams
A Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. That set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells. 
The use of Voronoi diagrams in R is documented in a pdf-file (voronoi_diagrams.pdf) and the accompanying R-script (voronoi.R).
